									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Thank you for checking this page out.&nbsp; Get to know a little more about me.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							    <p>Someone asked me once why I enjoy jigsaw puzzles so much.&nbsp; At the time, I didnt have an answer.&nbsp; Twenty years later, I now know.&nbsp; I enjoy creating order from chaos.&nbsp; How fitting for Data Analysis.&nbsp; You start with an idea of what the end picture looks like and work your way there.&nbsp; Searching, sorting, matching, and fitting the pieces together.&nbsp; Eventually, the story you are trying to tell comes together and the picture become more and more clear.&nbsp; This is where my passion lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
							    <p>Being known as "The Data Guy", I would always help my peers at work when it came to anything that had to do with numbers or a spreadsheet.&nbsp; This eventually grew into dashboards and visualization.&nbsp; I was enjoying it so much, I made the decision that it was time to explore turning my passion into a career.</p>

								<p>I enjoy going tent camping every year, especially in fall when the weather is cooling and the leaves are starting to change color.&nbsp; Northern Wisconsin is my favorite area to go.&nbsp; Rural areas lead to  relaxing retreats along side clear waterways, tall pines, and the sounds of nature.&nbsp; For as much as I enjoy sitting behind the computer screen working on projects, sometimes it is nice to unplug and spend some time away in the outdoors.</p>
								<p>When the weather is decent, I can usually be found outside with my pride and joy dogs; Lady and Deeks.&nbsp; Both Shepherd / Husky mixes with polar opposite personalities.&nbsp; Lady was a shy rescue that came from a hoarder who had 40 dogs on a small property in Mississippi.&nbsp; Deeks was picked up in Texas and looks like a German Shepherd with all of the attitude of a Husky.</p>
								<p>In the colder months, I can usually be found working on indoor hobbies.&nbsp; I enjoy reading a good non-fiction book, playing a video game, or talking with someone from around the world on one of my amateur radios in the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
